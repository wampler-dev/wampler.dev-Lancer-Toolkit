# OSR Foundry / Lancer Toolkit

A packet-based mission control toolkit for **Foundry VTT (v12+)** using the **Lancer RPG system**.

This repository contains **authoritative, GM-facing macros** developed to support structured Lancer play using packetized missions, with a strong emphasis on idempotence, auditability, and recovery.

See the `docs/` directory for installation, workflow, and conventions.
