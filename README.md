# OSR Foundry / Lancer Toolkit

A packet-based mission control toolkit for **Foundry VTT (v12+)** using the **Lancer RPG system**.

This repository contains **authoritative, GM-facing macros** developed to support structured Lancer play using packetized missions, with a strong emphasis on **idempotence**, **auditability**, and **recovery**.

In practice, this toolkit replaces ad-hoc scene, actor, and journal management with **deterministic packet state transitions** that can be safely re-run, inspected, and repaired.

See the `docs/` directory for installation, workflow, and conventions.  
If this is your first time setting up the toolkit, start with **`docs/installation.md`**.
