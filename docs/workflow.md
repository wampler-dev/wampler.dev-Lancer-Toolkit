# Gameplay Workflow

This document describes the expected GM loop during play.

Typical session flow:
1. Open Packet Dashboard.
2. Ensure exactly one Current + Active packet.
3. Run the scene.
4. Use Session Loop — One Button to advance state.
5. Monitor Threat and upcoming packets.

All macros are idempotent and safe to re-run.
